Solution for problem
**Test task:**


Given a simple String AABBCCD112233.

All you need is to return a new String, that will not contain any duplicates.

The code should be clean, readable and optimized.

Also, we expect to see test coverage with different test cases.


Please publish your code on GitHub and send us a link.

**Solution:**

```java
as part of implementation Ive created 3 different implementations
The idea is to show different ways of solving the problem and apply concepts of OOP (abstraction, polimormism) as well as functional programming
Also create test cases for each implementation using parameterized tests

1. Using Java Regular Expression
2. Using Java SortedSet
3. Using Java 8 Stream API and Collectors

Each implementation has their own pros and cons, but all of them are valid solutions for the problem, however talking talking BigO notation, the best solution is the one using Java SortedSet cause it shows the best way to calculate performance, the other 2 solutions can have some variation in performmance depending on the input size
